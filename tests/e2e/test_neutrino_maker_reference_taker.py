"""
End-to-end test: Neutrino Maker + Reference Taker (JAM).

Verifies what happens when a reference JoinMarket taker (jam-standalone) selects
a neutrino maker that cannot verify UTXOs without extended metadata.

Expected behavior:
1. The neutrino maker publishes standard sw0 offers (visible to all takers)
2. The reference taker may select the neutrino maker for a CoinJoin round
3. At the !auth stage, the neutrino maker cannot verify the taker's UTXO
   (no scriptpubkey/blockheight in legacy PoDLE format)
4. The neutrino maker sends !error back and drops the session
5. The reference taker treats this as a non-responsive maker
6. If enough other makers responded (>= minimum_makers), the CoinJoin succeeds
7. The taker's PoDLE commitment is NOT burned (hp2 not broadcasted on failure)

This test documents the current interoperability limitation and verifies that
reference takers are not harmed beyond a timeout delay.

Prerequisites:
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Run: docker compose --profile all up -d
  (or: docker compose --profile reference --profile neutrino up -d)
