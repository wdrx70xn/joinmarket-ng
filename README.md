# JoinMarket NG

JoinMarket NG is a modern implementation of the JoinMarket CoinJoin protocol for Bitcoin privacy.

It is wire-compatible with the reference JoinMarket network and supports both liquidity taking (`jm-taker`) and liquidity making (`jm-maker`).

## Quick Start

1. Install (Linux/macOS):

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joinmarket-ng/joinmarket-ng/main/install.sh | bash
source ~/.joinmarket-ng/activate.sh
```

2. Edit `~/.joinmarket-ng/config.toml` and set your backend (`descriptor_wallet` for Bitcoin Core, or `neutrino`):

```toml
[bitcoin]
backend_type = "descriptor_wallet"
rpc_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8332"
rpc_user = "your_rpc_user"
rpc_password = "your_rpc_password"
```

3. Create wallet and get deposit addresses:

```bash
jm-wallet generate
jm-wallet info
```

4. Run CoinJoin as a taker, or start earning fees as a maker:

```bash
jm-taker coinjoin --amount 1000000 --destination INTERNAL
# or
jm-maker start
```
