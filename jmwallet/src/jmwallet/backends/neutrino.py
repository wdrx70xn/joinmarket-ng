"""
Neutrino (BIP157/BIP158) light client blockchain backend.

Lightweight alternative to running a full Bitcoin node.
Uses compact block filters for privacy-preserving SPV operation.

The Neutrino client runs as a separate Go process and communicates via gRPC.
This backend wraps the neutrino gRPC API for the JoinMarket wallet.

Reference: https://github.com/lightninglabs/neutrino

Neutrino-compatible Protocol Support:
This backend implements verify_utxo_with_metadata() for Neutrino-compatible
UTXO verification. When peers provide scriptPubKey and blockheight hints
(via neutrino_compat feature flag), this backend can verify UTXOs without
arbitrary queries by:
1. Adding the scriptPubKey to the watch list
2. Rescanning from the hinted blockheight
3. Downloading matching blocks via compact block filters
4. Extracting and verifying the UTXO
