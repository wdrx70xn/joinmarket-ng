# Development

## Local Setup

From repository root:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

for d in jmcore jmwallet maker taker directory_server orderbook_watcher jmwalletd; do
  python -m pip install -e "./${d}[dev]"
done
```

## Tests

Fast unit test run:

```bash
pytest jmcore directory_server orderbook_watcher maker taker jmwallet
```

Full orchestrated suite (unit + Docker-backed phases):

```bash
./scripts/run_all_tests.sh
```

When selecting Docker-marked tests manually, use `--fail-on-skip`.

## Lint / Format / Type Check

Preferred:

```bash
prek run --all-files
```

Fallback:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Documentation

Build docs locally from repository root:

```bash
python scripts/build_docs.py
```

What this does:

- installs docs dependencies from `requirements-docs.txt`
- installs editable project packages used by API doc generation
- runs `properdocs build -q -f properdocs.yml` and writes output to `site/`

If you want to run the steps manually:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
python -m pip install -e jmcore -e jmwallet -e taker -e maker -e directory_server -e orderbook_watcher
python -m properdocs build -q -f properdocs.yml
```

For local preview:

```bash
python -m properdocs serve -q -f properdocs.yml
```

## Reference Compatibility Tests

Some e2e tests require a local clone of the reference implementation at repository root:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver.git
```

Then run marker-specific tests as needed (`-m reference`, `-m reference_maker`).

## Releases and Signatures

Reproducible release verification and signing workflows:

- build locally: `scripts/build-release.sh`
- sign: `scripts/sign-release.sh`
- verify: `scripts/verify-release.sh`

See [Signatures](../README-signatures.md) for repository signature layout.

### Pre-Release Preparation

Update dependencies, regenerate help text, run the full test suite, then
commit the resulting changes manually before bumping the version:

```bash
scripts/update-base-images.sh \
  && scripts/update-deps.sh \
  && scripts/update-flatpak-deps.py \
  && scripts/update_readme_help.py \
  && prek run --all-files \
  && scripts/run_parallel_tests.sh 2>&1 | tee tmp/run_parallel_tests.log
```

Review `tmp/run_parallel_tests.log`, then commit:

```bash
git add -p && git commit
```

### Local-First Workflow (Recommended for Release Managers)

Build, sign locally, then push. CI verifies independently against your
signed manifest.

```bash
# 1. Bump version — opens $EDITOR on CHANGELOG.md before committing/tagging
LEVEL=patch scripts/bump_version.py patch --no-push

# 2. Build release images locally (generates release-manifest-<version>.txt)
scripts/build-release.sh

# 3. Sign the locally-built manifest
VERSION=$(grep -oP '__version__\s*=\s*"\K[^"]+' jmcore/src/jmcore/version.py)
scripts/sign-release.sh "$VERSION" \
  --manifest "release-manifest-$VERSION.txt" \
  --key 1C53A412D11EF3051704419C44912E1E03005B31

# 4. Push commit, tag, and signature to trigger CI
git push && git push --tags
```

CI will build the same images independently and verify its layer digests
match your signed local manifest. The release is confirmed reproducible
when CI passes.

`release-manifest-<version>.txt` is gitignored — it is a build artefact
and is not committed to the repository.

**LEVEL**: `bump_version.py` accepts `patch`, `minor`, or `major` as its
positional argument. Set `LEVEL` as a shell variable if you want to
parameterise it:

```bash
LEVEL=minor  # or patch / major
scripts/bump_version.py "$LEVEL" --no-push
```

Note: strict layer-digest matching is currently skipped for `jam-ng` because
the CRA/webpack frontend build is non-deterministic across environments.

#### How reproducibility is achieved

Three inputs must match between local builds and CI builds for layer digests
to be byte-identical:

- `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`: derived from the release commit's timestamp.
- `JOINMARKET_BUILD_COMMIT` / `JOINMARKET_BUILD_REF`: stamped into wheel
  metadata via `jmcore/setup.py` (writes `_build_info.py`). When unset,
  `setup.py` falls back to `git rev-parse`, but the docker build sandbox
  has no `.git` directory, so passing these explicitly is required.
- Pinned base image digests, apt package versions, and pip build constraints
  (`setuptools`, `wheel`) — all enforced in the Dockerfiles.

`build-release.sh` derives commit/ref from the local git state and passes
them as `--build-arg` to `docker buildx build`, mirroring CI's
`release.yaml` invocation. `verify-release.sh --reproduce` does the same,
deriving the commit from the manifest and the ref from the tag pointing at
that commit (falling back to the supplied version). If you invoke
`docker buildx build` directly you must replicate this manually or
local/CI digests will diverge.

### CI-First Workflow (For Additional Signers)

Wait for CI to complete, then reproduce and sign:

```bash
VERSION=<version>
scripts/sign-release.sh "$VERSION" --key <fingerprint>
```

This downloads the CI manifest, rebuilds locally, and signs if digests
match. The same `jam-ng` skip rule applies for strict layer matching.

## Verify a Release

```bash
./scripts/verify-release.sh <version>

# with local reproduction check
./scripts/verify-release.sh <version> --reproduce
```

Reproduction uses Dockerfiles from the release commit to ensure strict
historical accuracy.

## Sign a Release

```bash
# Sign a CI-built release (downloads manifest, reproduces, signs)
./scripts/sign-release.sh <version> --key <gpg-key-id>

# Sign a locally-built manifest (from build-release.sh)
./scripts/sign-release.sh <version> --manifest release-manifest-<version>.txt --key <gpg-key-id>
```

For the local-first workflow, the manifest must come from the same release
commit as the local tag created by `bump_version.py`. `sign-release.sh` refuses
to sign a local manifest if its embedded `commit:` does not match the release
tag (or `HEAD` when no local tag exists).
