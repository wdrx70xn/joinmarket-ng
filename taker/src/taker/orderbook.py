    Choose n offers using per-slot probabilistic selection.

    **Pre-filtering** (when ``bondless_require_zero_fee`` is True):
    Bondless offers (``fidelity_bond_value == 0``) that charge a non-zero
    absolute fee are removed before selection.  This prevents an attacker
    from flooding the orderbook with fee-charging bondless offers to steal
    fees while still allowing genuine zero-fee bondless makers to participate.
    Relative-fee offers are kept because their effective fee depends on the
    CoinJoin amount and is evaluated elsewhere.

    **Per-slot selection** (for each of the *n* slots independently):

    * With probability ``bondless_makers_allowance``: pick **uniformly at
      random** from all remaining offers (bonded and bondless alike).  This
      gives every surviving offer equal probability, so a rare bondless maker
      naturally has low selection odds (``~ allowance / total_offers`` per
      slot).
    * Otherwise: pick from the bonded pool (``fidelity_bond_value > 0``)
      **weighted by bond value**.

    Fallback: if the chosen pool is empty the other pool is tried, then
    uniform random over everything remaining.

    This mirrors the reference JoinMarket implementation and ensures:

    * High-bond makers are strongly favoured (~80% of slots with default
      0.2 allowance).
    * When many bondless zero-fee makers exist, roughly
      ``n * bondless_makers_allowance`` of them appear in the final set
      (e.g. 2 out of 10).
    * When only a few bondless makers exist, each has low individual
      selection probability (proportional to ``1 / total_remaining``),
      avoiding taker fingerprinting.
    * Smaller bonded makers also benefit from the uniform-random slots.
