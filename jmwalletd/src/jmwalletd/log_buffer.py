"""In-memory ring buffer sink for jmwalletd logs.

jam's Logs page expects to fetch the daemon's recent log output as plain text.
The reference joinmarket-clientserver writes a ``jmwalletd_stdout.log`` file on
disk, but jm-ng currently logs only to stderr. Instead of forcing a file
dependency, we attach a loguru sink that keeps the most recent N formatted log
lines in a thread-safe deque; a small router serves that snapshot back to jam.

The buffer is bounded so long-running daemons cannot grow the heap
unboundedly, and a secondary soft cap on total bytes prevents pathological
spam from blowing past reasonable memory even within the line limit.
